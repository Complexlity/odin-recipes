    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Nigerian cooked beans with palm oil and sometimes plantain</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cigar cups (approx. 750g) brown/black eyed beans</li>
      <li>Red palm oil (enough to colour)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion</li>
      <li>1 big stock cube</li>
      <li>500g Yam/Plantain/Sweet Potatoes/Baby Corn (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak the beans in cold water for 5 hours. Boil the beans for 5 minutes and discard the water. Wash the beans in cold water and set aside. This soaking and pre-cooking process will help reduce the gas inducing elements.</li>
      <li>Chop the onions and grind the pepper.</li>
      <li>If you will use yam/plantain/sweet potatoes, wash, peel and cut them into 1 inch cubes and set aside. If you will use baby corn, drain the preservation liquid, rinse and set aside.</li>
      <li>Put the beans in a pot and pour water up to the level of the beans and start cooking.</li>
      <li>Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, if necessary. Always keep the water at the same level as the beans so that when the beans is done, you will not have too much water in the porridge.</li>
      <li>When the beans porridge is soft, add the onions, pepper and seasoning.</li>
      <li>Add the red palm oil, salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat, add the baby corn (if you have chosen to use it), leave to stand for 5 minutes and turn the porridge with a wooden spoon.</li>
    </ol>
